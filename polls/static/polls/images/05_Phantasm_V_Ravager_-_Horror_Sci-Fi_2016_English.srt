01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,889
Oh, come on, Rock,
don't be like that!

733
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,599
It's just one hand!

734
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,199
Ah, crap!

735
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,099
That'll do.

736
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,779
Thanks.

737
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,759
So, Rock...

738
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,889
You and me...

739
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,659
you know, any chance?

740
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:46,409
Well, I don't see
any other guys around.

741
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,449
You'll do for right now.

742
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,759
I can live with that.

743
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,559
Our ride's here.

744
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,999
How the hell...

745
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,519
Oh, for the love of god,
baldy, move over.

746
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,529
Phantasm Ravager...
